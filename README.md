Isoform Data are too big for this GIT, but the Data can be obtained using the code as provided

1) run the R code, getData.R
2) run SxG.py, to process the data in the right format
3) shrunken_centroid.py is now just a class with 1 important function of xikPrime(dmag), which computes the xikPrime given delta = dmag. 
4) main.py creates an object from class shrunken_centroid
